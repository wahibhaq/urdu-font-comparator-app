# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified

# You can edit the include path and order by changing the proguardFiles
# directive in build.gradle.

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Add this global rule
-keepattributes Signature

# This rule will properly ProGuard all the model classes in
# the package com.yourcompany.models. Modify to fit the structure
# of your app.
-keepclassmembers class projects.hobby.urdufontcomparator.models.** {
  *;
}
