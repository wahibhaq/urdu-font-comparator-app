# Urdu Font Comparator 

## Motivation

This project is about an Android application which allows users to choose different Urdu Fonts and visually see how it impacts sample Urdu text.

I wanted to play with Urdu fonts for a while but was still not getting a starting point or a solid motivation to do it. This idea originated since I read the news about a new and much improved font, [Meher Nastaliq](http://csalt.itu.edu.pk/urdufont/) launched by [Center for Speech and Language Technologies (CSaLT)](http://csalt.itu.edu.pk/) lab at [International Technical University (ITU)](http://itu.edu.pk/), Lahore (Pakistan). The website claims it to be a step towards advanced Urdu Typography and a font which serves the need of modern mobile applications. Even Dawn covered a [story](https://www.dawn.com/news/1313737) about it being a Calligraphy-based Urdu font for the Interent. It was enough to get my attention and wanted to try it out and also see how it is different from others specially Jameel Noori Nastaleeq Font which is considered the best so far. Then once I started thinking about it, I realized that there is no app or a resource where I can see how Urdu text looks like and rendered in different fonts (there are a lot actually!).


## Background

As mentioned, I started this project for a problem I was facing but I am quite hopeful that it will add some value for others as well. Long story short, It can assist you in making a better decision on chosing the right Urdu font for your Android app or mobile app in general. The font is the first contact, which the user makes with an application on his screen, and largely it is the choice and attractiveness of the font, which makes the application visually appealing. The beauty, aesthetics and size of a font are one of the key factors. The choice of font matters a lot because it makes the text more natural to read and fairly easy to understand.

Urdu is my mother tongue, National language of Pakistan and widely spoken in 6 countries by [60+ million people](http://mentalfloss.com/article/64594/proportional-map-worlds-largest-languages) but still Urdu as a language has not been sufficiently integrated with what we call "Digital Age". A significant number of Urdu speakers aren't technologically active, especially those residing in India and Pakistan due to poor economic conditions of the demographic. Among those active, majority of whom are Millenials don't write Urdu at all and are comfortable with using Roman Urdu as a medium of communication. I, myself, started using Urdu on Whatsapp and Messenger roughly 2 years ago after installing Urdu keyboard on my Android device. For strangers, they find it odd and fascinating at the same time but I am quite comfortable and also fluent with the writing speed.

I feel like there are several problems which need to be addressed. Firstly, we only have handful of websites (e.g [BBC-Urdu](http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/)) entirely in Urdu and even fewer mobile apps. Secondly, there's only a small chunk (e.g [Jang News](https://jang.com.pk/)) in Nastaliq script. Thirdly, Google Translator performs extremely poor with English to Urdu translation reducing reach. Last but not the least, there's a need to encourage our friends, family members and specially youth to proudly use Urdu as a communication medium and own it.  

### Naskh vs Nastaliq

By and large Arabic today is written in Naskh and subsequently the Urdu text you see on Web is also predominantly in Naskh script. Urdu is not a child of Arabic but somehow Nashk was accepted as de facto style for Urdu on Internet as well. The difference between Nastaliq and Naskh is much more than just a different font and Nastaliq is deeply connected to feelings of origin and pride of Urdu speakers (at least some). There is one more reason why nastaliq matters. It is, literally, calligraphy become language. I would ignore geo-political affiliation for now but confidently say that the past two or three generations of Urdu readers and writers grew up associating Nastaliq and Urdu almost exclusively with each other.  Nastaliq was the default script when reading Urdu books in schools. Therefore, we are so used to reading Urdu in Nastaliq that we can't even read properly in Naskh but still forced to read Urdu in Naskh on digital devices. Therefore, over years many people lost interest in the Urdu language. 

Whatever I write on this topic, it won't be as good as what [eteraz](https://twitter.com/eteraz) wrote in his article on [The Death of the Urdu Script
](https://medium.com/@eteraz/the-death-of-the-urdu-script-9ce935435d90). You should give it a read!

##### This is how both scripts look like.

A brief overview of both scripts:

#### Naskh 
Naskh though cursive is linear in nature. Each letter joins to the next moving from right to left. The glyphs change shape according to the place they occupy within the word. Strictly defined by norms laid down by tradition, the visual beauty of Naskh lies in the seamless manner in which each letter joins to the next letter to create a text which is as attractive as a visual drawing.

#### Nastaliq 
Nastaaliq is one of the most complex scripts to design. Unlike Naskh which is linear in nature, Nastaaliq moves both from right to left and vertically from top to bottom with the “nukte” or dots conforming to a strict placement order. Nastaaliq demands strict conformity with a specific grammar which has been honed and fine-tuned over the centuries.

Note: I have added couple of Naskh fonts in the app so that users can easily see the difference and appreciate how Nastaliq favors Urdu.

<!-- I plan to additional valuable information about fonts like Provider, File Size, Licenses, Performance metrics etc. -->

## How can I contribute?

Nothing special, just fork and create a PR with your contributions. Later, I plan to define a certain criteria for those who want to include a new font in the app. 

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me (obviously!) at wahib.tech@gmail.com or tweet me at @wahibhaq. I will also try to get in contact with the R&D team behind [Center for Speech and Language Technologies (CSaLT)](http://csalt.itu.edu.pk/), [ITU](http://itu.edu.pk/). They can be of great help to us.
