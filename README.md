# Urdu Font Comparator 

### What does this project do?

This project is an Android project which allows users to choose different Urdu Fonts and visually see how they effect Urdu text on a mobile screen. 

I wanted to play with Urdu fonts for a while but was still not getting a starting point or a solid motivation to do it. This idea originated since I read the news about a new and much improved font, [Meher Nastaliq](http://csalt.itu.edu.pk/urdufont/) launched by [Center for Speech and Language Technologies (CSaLT)](http://csalt.itu.edu.pk/) lab at [International Technical University (ITU)](http://itu.edu.pk/), Lahore (Pakistan). The website claims it to be a step towards advanced Urdu Typography and a font which serves the need of modern mobile applications. Even Dawn covered a [story](https://www.dawn.com/news/1313737) about it being a Calligraphy-based Urdu font for the Interent. It was enough to get my attention and wanted to try it out and also see how it is different from others specially Jameel Noori Nastaleeq Font which is considered the best so far. Then once I started thinking about it, I realized that there is no app or a resource where I can see how Urdu text looks like and rendered in different fonts (there are a lot actually!).


### Why this project can be useful for you?

As mentioned, I started this project for a problem I was facing but I am quite hopefuly that it will add some value for others as well. Long story short, It can assist you in making a better decision on chosing the right Urdu font for your Android app. 

Urdu as a language has not been integrated yet with what we call "Digital Age". We only have handful of websites entirely in Urdu and only a small chunk with the right Nastaleeq font style. Normally the Urdu text you see on Web is using the Naskh style but Nastaleeq style is what is natural for writing Urdu. The difference is here for you to see:

The choice of font matters a lot because it makes the text more natural to read and fairly easy to understand. I plan to additional valuable information about fonts like Provider, File Size, Licenses, Performance metrics etc. 

Additionally, I have also prepared a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ALNhvWif7xAcs0rAS3pC3jrJIX29eUw3KLKBWxXteIY/edit?usp=sharing) with all the fonts and their respective information.

### How do I get started?

Nothing special, just fork and create a PR with your contributions. Later, I plan to define a certain criteria for those who want to include a new font in the app. 

### Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me (obviously!) at wahib.tech@gmail.com or tweet me at @wahibhaq. I will also try to get in contact with the R&D team behind [Center for Speech and Language Technologies (CSaLT)](http://csalt.itu.edu.pk/), [ITU](http://itu.edu.pk/). They can be of great help to us.
